# Readable

Readable app is a basic skeleton for a content and comment web app. Users post content to pre-defined categories. Other users are then able to comment and vote on the posted content.

## Technologies Used / Required

This project uses React with Redux. To work properly, it relies on the server-side project [here](https://github.com/igor27school/reactnd-project-readable-starter).

## Installation

If you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), you can start this project (as well as the server-side project) by executing `yarn start` in the command line.

This project can also be started using `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

NOTE: This project only has support for localhost preview. It also has **ZERO** styling.

## License

This project is created as part of Udacity's React course curriculum. It can be used in any way you'd like.
